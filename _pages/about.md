I am a community ecologist, currently working as a postdoctoral associate in [Jeff Gore's group](http://www.gorelab.org) at MIT. I am generally interested in the mechanisms underlying the diversity and the stability of natural communities in the face of environmental change, with a focus on microbes. 

As a postdoc, I am studying the determinants of bacterial diversity and, in particular, the effects of resource availability on the richness and structure of microbial communities. To do so, I perform laboratory experiments using natural bacterial assemblages isolated from soil. 

During my PhD, working with [Lisandro Benedetti-Cecchi](https://sites.google.com/site/lisandrobenedetticecchi/as), I  investigated the impacts of extreme climatic events and the occurrence of regime shifts in rocky shore habitats, using microbial communities in the field as model systems. 



I obtained my Ph.D. in Marine Ecology from the University of Pisa, under the  supervision of Prof. Lisandro Benedetti-Cecchi. I received a B.Sc. degree in Marine Environmental Science from University of Genova and a M.Sc. degree in Marine Biology at the University of Pisa.
