I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Gore Lab](http://www.gorelab.org) at MIT. My first project was about the role of learning in the response to pheromones in the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans*. Now, I am interested in the mechanisms underlying biodiversity in microbial communities.

I obtained my Ph.D. at the Department of Marine Biology and Ecology, University of Pisa, in 2014. During my doctorate I worked under the supervision of Prof. benedetti-Cecchi and I investigated the effects of climate change on ecological memory of ecosystems and the occurrence of regime shifts. I used photosynthetic microbial biofilms developing on rocky shores as study system. I remained in the [Benedetti-Cecchi Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/lisandrobenedetticecchi/as) a postdoctoral researcher until 2016.

I received a B.Sc. degree in Marine Environmental Science from University of Genova in 2008 and a M.Sc. degree in Marine Biology at the University of Pisa in 2010. Both my master and my bachelor theses focused on the effects of protection on coastal fish assemblages.
