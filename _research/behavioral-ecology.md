<b>Food is heterogeneously distributed in space and time</b>. Animals, from wildebeests to soil nematodes, have to make important decisions when foraging. For example, they have to establish when it is a good time to leave a food patch and then choose where to go from it.

I studied the factors driving these important decisions using the model nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* and bacterial assemblages as model system. The reasons that make this a particularly suitable system to examine foraging-related questions are: 1. worms feed on bacteria and in the natural habitat of *C. elegans* - rotten fruits and stems - bacteria are patchily distributed; 2. worms can guess whether a patch is colonized by other worms thanks to the suite of pheromones they continuously release in the environment. 

We experimentally showed that worms consuming a food patch leave it at different times and that <b>the leaving time affects *C. elegans* preference for pheromones</b>. In particular, worms leaving early are attracted to pheromones, while worms leaving later are repelled by them. 
We further discovered that the inversion of pheromone response is driven by <b>associative learning</b>, whereby attraction or repulsion depend on the association of pheromones with food presence or absence, respectively.

Finally, by implementing a simple model, we highlighted that worms, by changing their pheromone preference while feeding, are able both to find rich patches and to avoid already exploited ones, ultimately <b>optimizing their food intake during foraging</b>.
