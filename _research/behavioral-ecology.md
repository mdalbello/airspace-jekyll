Chemical signals regulate the behavior of all organisms, from bacteria to humans.
Although examples of chemical communication were known since the ancient Greeks, it is in 1959, after the discovery of the silk moth sex cue bombykol, that Karlson and Lüscher introduced the term “pheromone”. Pheromones are molecules that are externally secreted by an organism and act by triggering a specific reaction, such as a stereotyped behavior and/or a developmental process, in another individual of the same species. Among other things, pheromones regulate mate selection, promote aggregation, and aid in locating food or avoiding predators; in many species, they constitute the basis for social interactions.


Since my bachelor studies, I’ve always been fascinated by chemical communication in animals and how this influences their ecology.
At MIT, I had the chance to pursue this old passion of mine and explore how responses to pheromones can be changed through experience.


I used as model system the nematode *C. elegans*, which is one of the most studied animals on earth and the first for which we have known the full genome and connectome.
*C. elegans* is convenient for these studies because it produces a peculiar family of molecules, called ascarosides, that signal population density and regulate worm development and behavior.
In addition, *C. elegans* exhibits impressive learning skills, being able to associate chemical cues to positive and negative stimuli and behave accordingly.
I discovered that attraction to ascaroside pheromones can be turned into repulsion through associative learning and that this behavioral plasticity may improve the foraging abilities of worms in their natural environment.
